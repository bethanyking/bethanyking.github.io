	<p>Once they’ve bonded with their owner, unicorns are easy to get along with and need little training. They need you to be consistent and fair, just like horses do. Your unicorn is more likely to misbehave when you’ve been neglecting it, or have kept it separate from other unicorns. It’s impossible to make a unicorn do something it doesn’t want to do. But unicorns respond well to positive reinforcement methods like clicker and target training.</p>
