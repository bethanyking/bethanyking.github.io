<h3>Feeding</h3>
	<p>Unicorns are much like horses and their diet reflects that. They are grazers, nibbling on lush grasses and plants that grow in their habitat. They will also eat grain when it’s available. As a treat, not only do they like carrots and apples as horses do, they are also particularly fond of berries. Care has to be taken not to let them eat too many berries, especially raspberries and strawberries at it will make their coats turn pink. Some people think that unicorns eat rainbows. This isn’t strictly true. Although they will readily consume rainbows, they do so for the moisture content. There’s very little nutrition in a rainbow. 
</p>
	<h3>Hoof Care</h3>
	<p>Unicorns may have cloven hooves like deer or cattle or they may have a single hoof like a horse. Like their horse cousins, they can have problems and need proper hoof care. Unicorns don’t do well when stabled and their hooves are prone to thrush and other problems caused by dark, damp conditions. But even unicorns that run free can get injuries and even hoof abscesses, also called gravelling in some places. Your farrier can help you determine a trim schedule - unicorn hooves are harder and slower growing than horses’ hooves. They are unlikely to need shoes. </p>
	<h3>Grooming</h3>
	<p>Grooming your unicorn is the same as grooming your horse with two exceptions. They will not tolerate being brushed with dirty brushes and they are very fussy about how their horns are handled. Some don’t like their horns touched at all. Others will allow you to polish and clean their horn. Anything that is used to condition the horn should be organic and vegetable based. </p>
	<h3>Riding</h3>
	<p>Riding a unicorn is very similar to riding a horse. Thankfully, unicorns don’t have the same saddle fitting problems that winged horses and pegacorns are known to have. Riding through forests takes a bit of care. If you ride through thick underbrush, there’s a chance the unicorn’s horn can get caught. If you ride beside another unicorn, you have to be careful not to turn your unicorn’s head too quickly, as the horn could hurt the animal next to it. This is something unicorns deal with very well with on their own, but it’s more difficult them when being ridden. For this reason too, unicorns should never be ridden or driven with blinders (blinkers). </p>
	<h3>Training</h3>
	<p>Once they’ve bonded with their owner, unicorns are easy to get along with and need little training. They need you to be consistent and fair, just like horses do. Your unicorn is more likely to misbehave when you’ve been neglecting it, or have kept it separate from other unicorns. It’s impossible to make a unicorn do something it doesn’t want to do. But unicorns respond well to positive reinforcement methods like clicker and target training.</p>
	<h3>Stabling</h3>
	<p>Again, unicorns don’t do well stabled. They may tolerate being in if the weather is very horrible, or they are sick or injured. But, it’s best to let your unicorn run free. Once bonded to their owner, they are unlikely to run away, and if they want to run away, no fence will keep them in. Ideally, your unicorn will need some nice pasture, and trees for windbreak and shelter. Unicorns don’t care to be blanketed either. But if you must blanket your unicorn they prefer rich solid colors and tassels or fringe on the borders.
